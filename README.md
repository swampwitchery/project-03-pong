### Description

This is a rendition of the retro two player Pong Game. Each paddle is controlled by a seperate player, first player to 10 wins the game. This was project 03 from RED Academy, as a code along - requirements were adding more vanilla Javascript/ES6 code to make it unique.

#### Stretch Goals

Decided to work on a couple stretch goals for this project. I added in a smaller second ball, to add a bit of difficulty to the game. I was also able to display the winner of the game once a player reaches 10 points. The game ends, and then by pressing space bar, it allows you to restart the game.
